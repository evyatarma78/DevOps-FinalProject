### *Project: Automated CI/CD Pipeline for a Web Application with Jenkins and Docker*  

#### *Overview:*  
Develop a full CI/CD pipeline using *Jenkins, Docker, and GitHub* to automate the building, testing, and deployment of a web application.

#### *Tech Stack:*  
- *Docker & Dockerfile* (Containerization)  
- *Jenkins* (CI/CD automation)  
- *GitHub* (Source code management)  
- *Python (Flask, BeautifulSoup, Requests, Regex)* (Web app that scrapes movie data, processes it, and displays a dynamic list)  
- *Nginx* (Reverse proxy for the deployed app)  
- *AWS EC2 / DigitalOcean / Local Server* (Deployment)  


### *Steps to Implement:*  

1. *Develop a Simple Web App*  
   - Create a basic Flask application with a simple UI.  

2. *Create a Dockerfile*  
   - Write a Dockerfile to containerize the application.  
   - Use docker-compose if needed for multiple services.  

3. *Set Up a Jenkins Pipeline*  
   - Install Jenkins and configure it with required plugins.  
   - Create a *Jenkinsfile* to define the CI/CD pipeline.  
   - Pipeline stages:  
     - Clone repository from GitHub.  
     - Build the Docker image.  
     - Run unit tests (if applicable).  
     - Push the Docker image to *Docker Hub / AWS ECR*.  
     - Deploy the container to a remote server.  

4. *Automate Deployment*  
   - Use *Docker Compose / Kubernetes* to manage container deployment.  
   - Set up an *NGINX reverse proxy* for the application.  

5. *Push the Code to GitHub*  
   - Automate the pipeline to trigger on git push.  
   - Ensure a successful deployment after each code change.

### *Extra Features (Optional):*  
- Add *webhooks* for automated triggers.  
- Implement *email/Slack notifications* for build status.  
- Use *Ansible/Terraform* for infrastructure provisioning.  
- Implement *monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana*.  

This project will demonstrate your expertise in *CI/CD, containerization, and automation*â€”perfect for a DevOps portfolio! ðŸš€
